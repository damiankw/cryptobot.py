create a 'get codebase' method which does the following:
- calculate the total bytes in all of the script filed
- write that to a file (or store it somewhere!)
- if this has changed in between runs, it's a new 'build'

also, make the user variables in a start.py and then pout the rest in another .py in classes plz
